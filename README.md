This is my 'Box of Beezz' drone synth using transistors as simple oscillators!


This build uses what is known as a relaxation oscillator. A relaxation oscillator is an oscillator that repeats itself over and over again from the charging of a capacitor to some event threshold and then the discharging of the capacitor. So basically the repetitive charging up of the capacitor and discharging of the capacitor creates oscillations via a transistor.


There are 9 in total built into the circuit and by using different capacitor values you can get different oscillations. The recharge and discharge time of the capacitor determines the time period and frequency of the oscillations


The LED connected to each oscillator acts as an output and these flicker on and off depending on the output signal. Plus, every project needs LED's!


Sawtooth oscillations are produced and they actually sound great. When you add 9 of them in total then you really get some interesting sounds generated.


There is also a master tone knob and I've included a control voltage output so you can hock the drone synth up to a sequencer.


The project was inspired by 'Look Mum No Computers' super simple oscillator build which I have linked here - https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/circledroneofdoom
